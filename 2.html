  Before getting started, I want to first explain what a webpage is.
   A webpage is basically a text file formatted a certain way so that your browser (ie. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc) can understand it; this format is called HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
   These files are located in computers that provide the service of storing said files and wait for someone to need them to deliver them.
  They are called servers because they serve the content that they hold to whoever needs it.

  These servers can vary in classes, the most common and the one that we'll be talking about in the main portion of this article is a web server, the one that serves web pages.
  We can also find application servers, which are the ones that hold an application base code that will then be used to interact with a web browser or other applications.
  Database servers are also out there, which are the ones that hold a database that can be updated and consulted when needed.

  These servers in order to deliver their content, much like in physical courier services, need to have an address so that the person needing said content can make a "letter" requesting the delivery;
  the person requesting the content in turn also has an address where the server can deliver the content to. These addresses are called IP (Internet Protocol) Address, a set of 4 numbers that range from 0 to 255 (one byte) separated by periods (ie. 127.0.0.1).

  Another concept that is important to know is that the courier service traffic for the delivery can be one of two: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
   Each one determines the way the content of a server is served, or delivered.

  TCP is usually used to deliver static websites such as Wikipedia or Google and also email services and to download files to your computer because TCP makes sure that all the content that is needed gets delivered.
   It accomplishes this by sending the file in small packets of data and along with each packet a confirmation to know that the packet was delivered;
   that's why if you are ever downloading something and your internet connection suddenly drops when it comes back up you don't have to start over because the server would know exactly how many packets you have and how many you still need to receive.
    The downside to TCP is that because it has to confirm whether you got the packet or not before sending the next, it tends to be slower.

  UDP, on the other hand, is usually used to serve live videos or online games. This is because UDP is a lot faster than TCP since UDP does not check if the information was received or not; it is not important. The only thing UDP cares about is sending the information. That is the reason why if you've ever watched a live video and if either your internet connection or the host's drops, you would just stop seeing the content; and when the connection comes back up you will only see the current stream of the broadcast and what was missed is forever lost. This is also true for online videogames (if you've played them you know exactly what this means)
